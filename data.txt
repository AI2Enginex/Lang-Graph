Balanced Advantage Funds: A Smart Investment Choicee

Balanced Advantage Funds have emerged as a smart investment choice in today's investment practices. They use a model-based approach and dynamically manage asset allocation between debt and equity, thereby effectively reducing downside risk and bringing stability to your portfolio. It also aims to generate risk-adjusted returns for investors. Of course, you must invest across several market cycles to get capital appreciation from risk-adjusted returns. But before discussing its benefits, it is important to understand Balanced Advantage Funds.

Understanding Balanced Advantage Funds

A Balanced Advantage Fund (BAF) is a hybrid mutual fund that invests in a mix of equity and debt instruments, which it manages dynamically, i.e., as per changing market conditions, it allocates the investments between equity and debt. When equity valuations look attractive, BAF increases equity exposure. When the equity valuations seem expensive, BAF reduces the equity allocation or hedges the equity portfolio. This enables you to benefit from equity market up-moves while keeping you safe from the down-moves.

5 Benefits of Investing in Balanced Advantage Funds (BAFs)

Potential for Stable Returns: By dynamically investing in both debt and equity, Balanced Advantage Funds (BAFs) could provide the potential for stable returns during market volatility.
Aim for Lower Risk: BAFs aim to balance risk and returns, potentially offering a lower-risk investment option compared to other equity mutual funds.
Dynamic Asset Allocation: With their dynamic asset allocation strategy, BAFs can adjust their exposure to different asset classes based on market conditions, providing flexibility and responsiveness to changing market trends.
Professional Management: BAFs are managed by professional fund managers who use model-based triggers to make investment decisions. This means that investors can potentially benefit from expert management without having to constantly monitor their investments.
Tax Efficiency: Compared to other investment options, BAFs may offer tax efficiency, helping investors maximize their returns. To maintain the equity status, funds may use the arbitrage strategy to reduce the net long equity positions. Consult your tax advisor before investing.
Things to Consider Before Investment

Before you invest in the best-balanced advantage fund of your choice, there are certain things that you have to keep in mind, which ultimately help you in making the right investment decisions. Let's take a look at them.

Your risk appetite: A balanced advantage fund is suitable for investors who have a moderate risk appetite and are looking for a balance between growth and stability. If you are willing to take more risk for higher returns, you may opt for a pure equity fund. If you are more conservative and prefer safety over returns, you may choose a pure debt fund.
Your investment horizon: A balanced advantage fund is ideal for investors who have a long-term investment horizon of at least five years. This is because the fund can adjust its asset allocation according to market conditions.
The fund's tax efficiency: A balanced advantage fund is taxed as an equity fund, which means that the long-term capital gains (LTCG) above Rs. 1 lakh are taxed at 10% and the short-term capital gains (STCG) are taxed at 15%.
Since we have talked about balanced advantage funds and their benefits, it brings us to another question.

Should I Consider Investing in Balanced Advantage Funds?

Balanced Advantage Funds can be a suitable investment option for many investors. Here are some factors to consider when deciding if these funds might be a good fit for you:

New Investors: If you are new to investing and want balanced exposure to both equity and debt securities with minimal risk, a Balanced Advantage Fund may be worth considering.
Experienced Investors: If you are an experienced investor looking for significant exposure to equities while limiting your downside through debt exposure, a Balanced Advantage Fund may be an option to explore.
Long-Term Goals: If you have long-term financial goals and are willing to invest for at least five years, a Balanced Advantage Fund can potentially benefit from capital appreciation over time.
Market Volatility: If you are concerned about the unpredictable market volatility of equity investments, a Balanced Advantage Fund can provide some stability by adjusting its asset allocation according to market conditions.
In summary, if you want to invest without any behavioural biases and with minimal risk, a Balanced Advantage Fund might be an option to consider. While these funds aim to provide stable returns over the long term while balancing growth and stability, it’s important to remember that all investments come with some level of risk.



ELSS Funds invests minimum 65% of its portfolio in Equity shares & can go upto 100% in Equity shares.
You get the best of both worlds: capital appreciation and tax savings from your stock investments.
There are no entry or exit loads in ELSS Mutual Funds.
If you want to earn a regular income, you may receive dividends or go with the growth option to gain capital appreciation.
They have a three-year mandatory lock-in term, the shortest of all tax-saving mechanisms.
WHAT ARE THE TAX BENEFITS OFFERED BY ELSS FUNDS?
ELSS mutual fund scheme investments qualify for a tax deduction under section 80C. However, any redemption or switch out undertaken in the scheme after the lock-in period is subject to taxation. Long-term capital gains tax applies to equity mutual funds held for longer than one year, but if the profits reach Rs 1 lakh in a financial year, they are taxed at a rate of 10% without indexation advantage.

WHY SHOULD YOU INVEST IN ELSS MUTUAL FUNDS?
There are certain benefits of investing in ELSS mutual fund schemes.

SAVE TAX AND GENERATE WEALTH OVER TIME
To begin with, ELSS funds are mutual funds that invest in stocks. They are multi-cap funds, which invest in firms of all sizes - large, mid, and small - across all industries. And, as an equity mutual fund, it can generate wealth through equities over time.

To put it another way, investing in ELSS allows you to build wealth over time like any other equity mutual fund. In addition, investment in an ELSS provides tax benefits that no other mutual fund does.

SHORTER LOCK-IN PERIOD
ELSS earns an extra point for its lock-in duration compared to other tax-saving investing alternatives. For example, PPF has a 15-year lock-in time, ULIP has a 5-year lock-in period, tax-saving FDs have a 5-year lock-in period, and NSC has a 5-year or 10-year lock-in period. In comparison, the ELSS lock-in duration is only three years.

START BY INVESTING SMALL THROUGH SIPS
ELSS can be purchased using a systematic investment plan (SIP) like all other mutual funds. For as little as Rs 500, you can begin a SIP for an ELSS mutual fund. And like other mutual funds, you can raise your investment amount through SIP top-up as your income rises.

Most other tax-advantaged investment options don't allow you to invest money systematically every month.

WHAT ARE THE FACTORS TO CONSIDER BEFORE INVESTING IN ELSS FUNDS?
When deciding whether or not to invest in an ELSS mutual fund, keep the following points in mind:

INVESTMENT HORIZON
To invest in ELSS funds, you must have a longer-term investment horizon than five years. This is because ELSS funds' equity involvement necessitates a longer investment horizon to limit market volatility.

INVESTMENT RETURNS
You should be aware that ELSS funds do not guarantee returns because their success is contingent on the performance of the underlying stocks. Having a longer investment horizon than 5 years, on the other hand, can yield better returns than any different tax-saving investing strategy.

LOCK-IN PERIOD
The lock-in period for ELSS mutual funds is three years. This is because your investments are required to be locked in for three years from the date of acquisition, and you cannot redeem them until the whole time term is up.

CONCLUSION
ELSS funds are a two-in-one investment vehicle. It not only helps you save money on taxes, but it also helps you build significant wealth with that money. As a result, you may put these assets toward long-term goals like kid education and retirement, where you'll need to outperform inflation by a large margin.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
What is the best way to invest in ELSS?
ELSS can be bought in the same way as any other mutual fund. The most straightforward method is to open an Online Investment Services Account. You have the option of investing in a lump sum or through a SIP (systematic investment plan).

Is investing in ELSS a good idea?
It is good to have a mix of equity mutual funds and debt funds to minimize risk. But investing in ELSS is a good idea. ELSS funds are suitable for long-term investors who want to gain exposure to the stock market while avoiding taxes. There are several ELSS funds available.

Is ELSS better than PPF?
ELSS investments are focused on equity and have a higher level of volatility than PPFs, which are debt instruments with low volatility. Under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961, you can claim a maximum deduction of INR 1.5 lakh with both ELSS and PPF.

2. How should I invest in mid and small caps?
Should you invest directly in mid and small caps or should you invest via a fund? As mentioned above, mid and small caps can be very volatile. The reason for their volatility is that their underlying businesses can go through sharp ups and downs with changing economic scenarios. That’s why during boom times, they do well; and during doom times, they crash. Thus, when you pick mid and small caps, you should be absolutely certain of their quality and business strength. If you can do stock research on your own and have the time to track the performance of companies, you can invest in mid and small caps directly.

However, most investors will have problems navigating this tricky space. So, the mutual fund route remains the better option for the majority. With mutual funds, you can get the services of an experienced fund manager who will pick winning mid and small caps on your behalf. If your chosen fund underperforms, you can also switch to a better one. Last but not least, when you invest in a mid- or small-cap fund, you get a diversified portfolio straightaway. All these help you lower your risk and optimise your returns.

3. What’s the right time to invest in mid and small caps?
Should you invest in mid and small caps when they are down? Or should you invest in them irrespective of the fact where they are headed?

Let’s take these scenarios over the last 10 years for the BSE 150 MidCap and BSE 250 SmallCap indices:

You invest in the two indices when they have fallen by 2% or more with respect to the previous day’s close.
You invest in the two indices on the first of every month, irrespective of the market levels.
The charts below show the (XIRR) returns you would make.

4. How much allocation should I have in mid and small caps?
If you have made up your mind to add mid and small caps to your portfolio, the question that arises now is how much should you allocate to them? There is no right or wrong answer to it. It all depends on your risk appetite and how comfortable you are with the volatility in your portfolio.

If you would like to have a basic equity portfolio, you can avoid mid- and small-cap funds altogether and focus on just flexi-cap funds. Flexi-cap funds will have allocations to mid and small caps, as deemed fit by the fund manager.

However, if you would like to add a kicker to your portfolio returns, you can add mid- and small-cap funds to it. But avoid going more than 30-40% of your total portfolio. While a larger percentage of mid and small caps can boost your returns, they also make your portfolio more volatile. Hence, choose cautiously.

As far as stock investors are concerned, they would find many worthwhile options in the mid-cap space and hence can’t really ignore it. The idea is to be prudent with stock selection. As far as small caps are concerned, even stock investors can do without them if they don’t want extra volatility in their portfolios.

If you do invest in small-cap stocks, understand that you must research them even more profoundly than mid caps. There is often limited information about small caps in the public domain and hence you must be willing to dig deeper.



Mukesh Ambani is disrupting Rs 44.4 Lakh Cr mutual fund sector in Jio way!

He made Jio Blackrock, a JV (50:50) with world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock with an initial capital of Rs 2380 Cr.

They are set to begin with low-cost passive products.

JFS (Jio Financial Services) has received Rs 20700 Cr liquid assets from Reliance Services.

Here’s his roadmap:

- Enter B2B credit business.
- Get in consumer lending.
- Break into insurance, payments, digital broking and asset management.

Though JFS has to face tough tests from 40+ competitors and regulations.

Such as,

- SBI, ICICI, HDFC, Nippon, Kotak Mahindra, ABSL and Axis are top players holding 80% share of this industry.

- Bajaj Finserv has entered it recently.

- Paytm, PhonePe, Simpl and CRED are there in lending.

- Zerodha is also set to launch mutual funds as it'll get a final signal from SEBI soon.

It’ll build a platform with smallcase.

As Rs 5.4 Lakh Cr is invested in ETFs which is 12% of total assets under AUM (Asset Under Management), Ambani has seen AUM of India's MF industry 2X in last 5 years.🇮🇳

Here are 5 strategies Mota Bhai is using to apply his JIO playbook:

1. Noble Mission:

Due to issues in distribution, millions of retail investors can’t buy passive funds.

He's set to remove them and make it seamless.

His target is to democratise investing in India through “Fit for India” movement.

2. Partnership:

Blackrock’s digital platform Aladdin (Asset, Liability, Debt and Derivative Investment Network) fits his plan for India.

Aladdin is used by 200+ global firms.

It’ll leverage tech and data to bring affordable and innovative solutions.

3. Advantage:

It’s set to leverage its footprint at 18500+ stores of Reliance Retail and 448.5 million subscriber base of Jio.

4. Untapped market:

As India is set to be world's 3rd largest economy in 4 - 7 years, working portion of 1.4 billion population will invest more.

Such as people from Tier-2, Tier-3 cities and beyond are still untapped.

5. Track record:

After demerger, JFS has already 3rd largest NBFC in India with Rs 1.66 Lakh Cr valuation.

In telecom, he’s erased all competitors in only 7 years which he’s copying here.

On other hand, Blackrock left India in 2018 when its 60:40 JV with DSP group fell apart. It’ll revise its last mistakes.

As ratio of mutual fund AUM to India’s GDP is only 16% compared to world's average of 63%, it’s a huge scope of growth.🚀

Under Isha Ambani's leadership, it'll be interesting to see growth of JFS.

PS- Despite being listed recently, Ambani fever has already fallen shares of Indian companies.😅

Can Ambani be successful in disruption again?

Do you think it’ll be easy to repeat JIO strategy this time?

HOW DOES SIP WORK?
A systematic investment plan (SIP) is a simple instrument that allows you to create wealth by making small, regular deposits over a longer time horizon. There are many benefits of SIP investment in mutual funds.

When you start SIP in a mutual fund scheme, you can buy a set number of fund units. You can invest in the fund at both highs and lows. You don't have to time the market to earn money. This element of uncertainty is removed with SIP investing.

You can select to automate your investments once you've chosen the investment term and frequency. Then, give your bank a standing instruction to transfer money from your bank account to the mutual fund SIP of your choice regularly (monthly, quarterly, etc.).

WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF SIP IN MUTUAL FUNDS?
Benefits of SIP in Mutual Funds

MARKET VOLATILITY DOES NOT AFFECT THE INVESTMENTS
Markets reflect the economy, and just as the economy experiences ups and downs, so do the markets. So while a drop in the market might wipe out some of your gains, a SIP can make these dips work in your favor.

One of the advantages of SIP prevents investors from speculating in highly volatile markets. When the market is low, investors may buy more units, and they can buy a few units when the market is high. As a result, the long-term average cost of each unit is anticipated to be cheaper, while the investment returns are excellent.

Because you invest every month, the NAV of every scheme varies, and you receive a different amount of units each month. When the markets rise, the price will increase each month, and you will receive fewer units. When the cycle reverses and markets begin to decline, the purchase price drops, and you start to get more units for the same investment. Rupee Cost Averaging is the process of investing at different periods of the market to average out the costs.

HELPS TO BUILD CORPUS WITH SMALL AMOUNTS
Another benefit of SIP investment is that it allows you to invest in mutual funds with as little as Rs. 500 per month. So even if you don't have a lot of money, you may benefit from India's growth by investing in mutual funds.

This might be a cost-effective approach to invest each month without going over budget. With the SIP step-up function, you may raise your monthly investment amount as your income rises. In addition, investors can top up their SIPs regularly with mutual fund firms.

When you regularly invest in a mutual fund scheme through a systematic investment plan (SIP), your total investment amount rises to a sizable corpus over time. The benefit of compounding is one of the main reasons for your corpus's growth. Because mutual fund returns are reinvested, and you get returns on your returns, you profit from this simple yet powerful force known as compounding.

YOU BECOME MORE DISCIPLINED WITH YOUR SAVINGS
A well-known advantage of SIP investments is that it allows investors to have a disciplined approach towards savings. In addition, it instils some financial discipline in the form of a monthly budget. Because SIPs are very flexible, they may be stopped at any moment, and investors can choose to raise or reduce their investment amount.

You may follow the golden rule of personal finance by using SIP to save first and spend later. All you have to do now is choose a monthly SIP date that coincides with your salary date. And before you start spending, you'll wind up investing every month

BOTTOM LINE
There are many benefits of SIP investments in mutual funds apart from the top 3 mentioned here, like convenience, diversification, flexibility, no charges to start a SIP, etc. In addition, SIP defies the traditional belief that making money takes a lot of planning and work. In reality, SIP demonstrates that you must avoid any complicated investment methods such as market timing and instead invest regularly to manage your funds appropriately.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Can I Lose Money In SIP?
Yes, to an extent. As mutual funds are subject to market risks, an investor can lose some money as the fund houses invest in stocks, commodities, etc. But the most significant advantage of investing in mutual funds via SIP is staying invested for a long time and not letting the market’s ups and down bog you down.

Can I Withdraw SIP Anytime?
Most mutual fund schemes are open-ended and can be redeemed anytime. It mostly charge exit load of up to a year, after which there are no loads on investment redemption.

Which SIP is more beneficial?
There are many types of SIP- daily, monthly and quarterly. Depending on the risk tolerance and the amount of money available at your disposal for investment, you can choose a more suitable SIP option for yourself.

India has about 284 index funds and ETFs but retail adoption has been low, which is attributed to distribution related bottlenecks. Just the way banks use their branches and digital platforms to cross-sell an entire suite of financial products, Jio BlackRock can also do it by using the vast reach of RIL's twin consumer businesses - Jio and Retail.

BlackRock’s digital platform Aladdin—the Asset, Liability, and Debt and Derivative Investment Network--fits into Ambani’s plan of using data and technology to disrupt the Indian financial markets.

If JFSL choses to focus on passive products, then its success would not only depend on cracking the distribution puzzle but also generating alpha over active funds.

"Active fund performance in India has been quite healthy over long timeframes. We believe that India as a market will remain commission-driven for the next 3-5 years, which automatically restricts the runaway adoption of passive funds through the advisory route. Further, the current regulatory design has a good alignment of interests across customers distributors-AMCs with pass-through of scale benefits built into TERs," Sakhare said.

Passive-heavy fund houses need scale for liquidity and lower price-NAV gap with scope for consistent price reductions. "While the performance of active funds swings through cycles, fund houses with a healthy active share and a balanced product portfolio will remain relevant.

Identifying winners is probably not required at this stage of growth, but passive opportunity in India (unlike the US) could be captured within the existing set of incumbents," the analyst said.

The other big challenge for Jio will be to tackle the rising competition in a tight regulatory environment.

Bengaluru-based startup billionaire Nithin Kamath, who had disrupted India's stock broking industry with Zerodha’s cheap brokerage plans just like what Jio did in the telecom business, is awaiting a final nod from Sebi for launching mutual funds.

Zerodha, which is partnering with fintech smallcase for the AMC business, has planned a lean and tech-first platform which can make the selection of mutual funds easier. It is lining up only passive products targeted at long-term investors.

The latest entrant in the industry is Bajaj Finserv which has also built its business model around data and technology.

"We will only enter those active categories where we see an opportunity to generate alpha. If not, we will enter them through the passive space. Even in passive, we’re looking at passive allocation but active management, or what we call smart beta funds," Ganesh Mohan, CEO, Bajaj Finserv AMC, had told ET recently.

As the ratio of mutual fund AUM to the country's GDP is 16% compared to the global average of 63%, the runway to grow is huge but given the competition and Jio’s late entry the battlefield isn’t going to be an easy one.

There are three major categories of mutual funds according to the market caps. These are large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap mutual funds. Investment in small-cap mutual funds is associated with higher risk levels than large and mid-cap funds as they invest in lesser-known and under-researched companies. Small-cap schemes can witness intense volatility during bearish market phases. but they can even outperform all categories of mutual funds over the long term. Here is a list of 10 small-cap funds with the highest three-year returns as per data based on data available on Value Research.


Small cap mutual fund schemes witnessed a massive increase in the inflow of funds by 67 percent in the month of June to hit a high of ₹5,471.75 crore against ₹3,282.50 crore in the preceding month, showed the latest AMFI data. 

In other news, capital markets regulator Sebi has allowed mutual funds to introduce five new categories under ESG (environmental, social, and governance) scheme and put in place a disclosure framework for them.

In the Indian financial landscape, mutual funds have seen a considerable metamorphosis, going from a mysterious investment option to a renowned financial vehicle. The mutual fund industry is poised for a transformation as a result of the growing popularity of index funds, the effects of regulatory changes, and the rising interest in specialised industries like digital technology or healthcare. That’s why by the year 2024, it will be essential to analyse market trends and map out the industry’s potential future course. 


Everyone learns by making mistakes. It is easy to say that you can learn from other people’s mistakes. Evolution is a process through which you emerge stronger, smarter, and sturdier by making mistakes and placing guardrails that prevent future generations from repeating them. The story of debt funds in India is one of learning from mistakes and hopefully coming of age and maturing.

The chase for yield resulted in fund manager fatigue. The fund management turned passive while the regulator turned active. Increased changes in policy from global central banks to avoid economic slowdown and inflation resulted in shorter interest rate cycles and sharper fluctuation in bond prices. A few high-rated issuers and numerous low-rated corporate issuers chose to default on their obligations leading to heavy losses for debt schemes and fund houses who had taken exposure to low credit papers in an attempt to shore up portfolio yields. Interest rate bets did not pay off as well as global volatility in inflation and yields resulted in an uneven experience for the Indian debt investor who had assumed high smooth returns as a given.

The fall in AUM of SBI Mutual Fund and UTI Mutual Fund's Nifty 50 ETF, where EPFO has a large equity exposure, outstripped the fall in the index in Jan-Feb, suggesting high redemptions by the provident fund.

#LIC #MF LAUNCHES INSTANT #REDEMPTION IN #LIQUIDFUNDS (in partnership with #RBLBank)

MUMBAI - The decline in assets under management of SBI Mutual Fund and UTI Mutual Fund's Nifty 50 exchange-traded funds, wherein the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation has a large equity exposure, outstripped the fall in the index during the first two months of the calendar year, suggesting high redemptions by the country's largest provident fund.  

The quantum of the fall was, however, not large enough to put any significant selling pressure on the index stocks.

TREND

Since December, the Nifty 50 has been registering a decline every month. Typically, when the index falls, an index ETF's assets under management also decline in sync. However, if the fall in an ETF's assets is more than that in the index, it shows redemptions were higher than the inflows.

Under the government mandate, the EPFO invests in equities through Nifty 50 and Sensex ETFs of SBI Mutual Fund and UTI Mutual Fund. Half-yearly disclosures by the two fund houses reveal up to 75% concentration of assets in their respective ETFs by large unit holders, presumably accounts operated by EPFO.

"The mutual fund industry has seen outflows in equity ETFs due to EPFO redemptions," Manish Mehta, national head of sales, marketing and digital business at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co, said. In fact, the overall flows into equity ETFs weakened, resulting in a net outflow of around 17 bln rupees in January, followed by a marginal net inflow of 290 mln rupees in February.

WHAT NUMBERS REVEAL

For the two EPFO-dominated Nifty 50 ETFs, the fall in assets outpaced the index's 2.4% fall in January and 2% fall in February. SBI Mutual Fund's Nifty 50 ETF lost 3.8% assets in January, with end-of-month assets at 1.49 trln rupees. As per back of the book calculations, the ETF suffered net redemptions of 21 bln rupees going by the fact that its 3.8% fall was higher than the index's 2.4% decline.

In February, the ETF's assets declined 3.6% to 1,435.9 bln rupees, with calculations showing net redemptions at 23.4 bln rupees. The combined redemptions for January and February were at 44.4 bln rupees, according to calculations.

This trend was in sharp contrast with the preceding four months when the assets' increase or decline as against the Nifty 50's rise or fall showed net inflows of 85.7 bln rupees.

UTI Mutual Fund's Nifty 50 ETF showed a similar trajectory. Its assets fell 4.3% on month to 381.9 bln rupees in January, and then again by 2.5% in February. According to calculations, there were net redemptions of 8.9 bln rupees in Jan-Feb as against net inflows of 26.6 bln rupees in Sep-Dec.

EPFO POLICIES

EPFO can invest 5-15% of the incremental corpus of Employees' Provident Fund and Employees' Pension Scheme every year in equities. Currently, these are permitted only through Nifty and Sensex ETFs of SBI Mutual Fund and UTI Mutual Fund. At the end of 2021-22 (Apr-Mar), the EPF corpus invested in equity ETFs was at 1.02 trln rupees and made up for 9.2% of the total EPF investments. Similarly, 7.8%--or 529 bln rupees--of the total corpus of Employees' Pension Scheme was invested in equity ETFs.

The EPFO also has a redemption policy in place which, among other things, aims to book profit in equities after the investment committee weighs market conditions and valuation levels. Given that the Nifty 50 registered a decline in the past three months, it is possible that the EPFO has been booking profits. However, according to analysts, since incremental contributions to Employees' Provident Fund and Employees' Pension Scheme are a regular occurrence, there is a strong probability of a rebound when valuations get attractive.  End

Ensuring more participation by MFDs - not only will MF Industry corpus grow, but the same funds will get utilized in development of our economy thru Debt & Equity. Savings will be channeled into productive direction to help grow #GDP. 
GST contribution from commissions on Mutual Fund Investments is actually a negligible contributor to the exchequer. But removing these hurdles by removing GST, adding more MFDs to become active in this business can only help economic growth and GDP growth of our country 

Humble request to @nsitharaman and @PMOIndia to consider removing GST on commissions earned by MFDs.

Trade off between GDP growth and not charging GST on commissions is hugely in favour of former by encouraging more MFDs to become active & reach $5 trln economy 


1. One year doesn’t mean much with #MF #SIPs

a) Those who began an #SIP a year back, i.e, at the start of 2018, may be breaking into a sweat right now because the SIP NAVs of equity funds have dipped anywhere in the range of -2 to -20% in 2018.
(2/6) 
b) Still, considering the fact that equities generally do well over the long run negative returns within a period of just 12 months can be safely ignored.
(3/6) 
2. Look beyond temporary market volatility and keep SIPPING

a) SIPs tend to do well over three-year and five-year horizons.
(4/6) 
b) Data reveals that as on January 14, 2019, average returns of #SIPs in all equity funds over a one-year period stood at -3.9%.
(5/6) 
3. Volatility’s no worry for #SIPs as the inflows keep rising, #AMFI data shows.
Thanks for noticing this.  We are very particular about highest credit quality in our funds, especially hybrid.  

Conservative funds in our view are not a place to take cute risks with fixed income.

While everyone knows our love and passion for BAF, we really are believers in the entire hybrid category.  Funds that let you earn returns with downside protection, and tax efficiency.  Explore our House of Hybrids!

My wife is investing  40% of her salary in mutual fund and she is happy with edelweiss small & midcap returns.

Have come to a conclusion that when in doubt just pick @EdelweissMF and trust their wisdom and @iRadhikaGupta. Pick any mutual fund from their portfolio and you won't repent. Bring time on your side to play for you. Thank you team @EdelweissFin.

Just heard Nilesh Bhai on his webcast about Market outlook.  Similar sentiment expressed by him too.
